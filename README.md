# ARM Cortex-M4 Embedded Applications

Real-time embedded systems projects on the STM32F411RE Nucleo board (ARM Cortex-M4), developed using C and ARM Assembly. These applications demonstrate practical microcontroller programming, low-level peripheral control, and real-time responsiveness through UART, GPIO, timers, interrupts, and sensors such as DHT11.

Developed as part of the course **Microprocessors and Peripherals** at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTH), School of Electrical & Computer Engineering.

##  Contents

This repository contains three standalone projects, each designed to highlight key embedded systems concepts:

###  1. Hash & Fibonacci Calculator (Assembly-C Hybrid)

- Parses alphanumeric strings received via UART
- Computes a hash based on character types:
  - Uppercase: `ASCII × 2`
  - Lowercase: `(ASCII - 'a')²`
  - Digits: mapped via lookup table
- Reduces hash using digit-sum + `mod 7`
- Calculates Fibonacci of final value in ARM Assembly
- Final result is printed via UART

 Folder: `lab1-hash-fibonacci/`

###  2. LED Control via Digit Analysis & Interrupts

- User inputs integer via UART
- Timer interrupt triggers digit-by-digit analysis every 0.5 sec
- Even digit → blink LED (200ms)
- Odd digit → toggle LED state
- Button interrupt can lock/unlock LED activity
- New number input restarts the process
- Input ending in `-` triggers continuous loop mode

 Folder: `lab2-digit-led-interrupt/`

###  3. Environmental Monitoring System (DHT11 + Touch + Panic Reset)

- UART menu to configure sampling frequency and display mode
- Touch sensor toggles between Normal and Alert modes
- Alert mode:
  - If Temp > 25°C or Humidity > 60% → LED blinks every 1 sec
  - Resets to normal after 5 stable readings
- Dynamic frequency based on last AEM digits
- UART `status` command prints current state and readings
- Software panic reset if:
  - Temp > 35°C or Hum > 80% for 3 consecutive reads

 Folder: `lab3-environment-monitor/`
